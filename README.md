# MoonLamp

A 3D printed MOON LAMP with the  with a customizable pedestal! Find out how we made it below!

## Project description

### What can this project do?
This project is a remake of the original moonlamp made by ..... .
We've just added the Whaddy logo with Meshmixer (a 3D model program) so that it looks like Whaddy shadows on the moon. And made a sharp looking pedestal for it.
The Moonlamp can be powered with any decent (in our case) 24VDC power supply. It is lit up with a normal white 24V led strip, but you can choose any you prefer...
The brightness is adjustable with a potentiometer, and we've also built in handy power jack3

## PREPPING THE BUILD

### 3D printing the MOON and LED HOLDER
As mentioned before, all info on the original moonlamp can be found here https://www.instructables.com/High-Detailed-Moon-Lamp/ 

The STL files can be downloaded here:
- Whaddy Moon Lamp
- Led holder

### Printing the template

We have made the pedestral out of PCB material on our PCB milling machine. But you can make it out of Cardboard, 3D print it or make it with whatever you want :)
Below thee template the you can print out and use it yourself!
The Stl files for the pedestral can be downloaded here


### Prepping the connections

An connection sheme can be found below, we've added an potaentiomer to adjust the brightness and build in an DC plug to power the moonlamp.
