A 3D printed MOON LAMP with a customised stand! Find out how we made it below!

## Project description

### What can this project do?
This project is a remake of the original moonlamp can you find here:https://www.instructables.com/High-Detailed-Moon-Lamp/ .  
We've added the Whaddy logo with Meshmixer (a 3D model program) so that it looks like a Whaddy shadow on the moon. We also made a sharp looking stand for it for it.
The Moonlamp can be powered with any decent (in our case) 24VDC power supply. It is lit up with a normal white 24V led strip, but you can choose any you prefer...
The brightness is adjustable with a potentiometer, and we've also built in handy power jack3

## Material

![Ingredients](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/Ingredients.jpg)

### Ingredients:

* 1x 3D Printed Moon lamp
* 1x 3D printed LED holder
* 3X Side plate
* 1x Back plate
* 1x Cross plate1
* 1x Cross plate2
* 1x Base plate
* 10cm of 24VDC LED strip (or any LED stip you prefer) 
* 24VDC power supply (make sure to use the rigt power according to your LED strip)
* 1x DC jack (optional)
* 1x potentiometer 1-10K (optional)
* soft electrical wires
* Heat shrinks

### Tools:

* 3D Printer
* Soldering Iron
* Glue gun

## Prepping the buils

### 3D printing the MOON and LED HOLDER
As mentioned before, all info on the original moonlamp can be found here https://www.instructables.com/High-Detailed-Moon-Lamp/ 

The STL files can be downloaded here:
- [Whaddy Moon Lamp.stl](https://vellemannv-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/nl_velleman_eu/EXgCJCqtD_RAr7959jyvImQBmb11U-QMWAOz8YXYz5xswQ?e=Y641Qv)
- [Led holder.stl](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/LEDholder.stl)


**When importiing the file in your slicer, move the moon about 8-10mm down. Ths way we wil have a hole at the bottom for us to put the leds in...**

### Printing the template for the stand

We have made the pedestral out of PCB material on our PCB milling machine. But you can make it out of Cardboard, 3D print it or make it with whatever you want :)
Below thee template that you can [download](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/Template.pdf) and print out to use it yourself!

### Prepping the connections

An connection sheme can be found below, we've added an potentiomer to adjust the brightness and build in an DC plug to power the moonlamp.
You can also connect the your ledstip directly to a power supply, but then cant adjust the brightnes and its not very handy...

## Making the Moonlamp

1. Take 'Cross plate 1' and 'Cross plate 2'.  
![1](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/1.jpg)

Then slide them together, like in the picture below  
![1b](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/1b.jpg)

2. Take the 'Base plate' and fix it to the cross we just made. there are slots in the baseplate, align them with the protrusions of the Cross plates anthe push them together  
![2](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/2.jpg)

3. Place a 'Side plate' to the assembly. There is a slot in the sideplate, push it on the protrusion of the 'Cross plates'. see picture below  
![3](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/3.jpg)

4. Now take another sideplate, first slide it onto the previous sideplate  
![4](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/4.jpg)

5. then push it in place...  
![5](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/5.jpg)

6. Repeat the last two steps for the next sideplate.

7. The Last sideplate (or Back Plate) will be the hardest. You will hve to wriggle a bit to get it in place.

8. Now take the 3D printed LED strp holder and a piece of ledstrip.   
![8](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/8.jpg) 

Stick the Ledstrip onto the holder like in the picture below. Make sure the power wires are in the cut out of the holder!

9. Guide the wires trough the hole in the baseplate.

10. if you are going to build in a potentiometer, bend the pins in a 90Â° angle:  
![10](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/10.jpg)

11. before we start soldereing. Test fit the potentiometer and power jack, this way we know how long the cables need to be  
![11](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/11.jpg)

12. Start soldering wires to the DC jack (middle pin is +)  
![12](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/12.jpg)

13. solder the + wire from the DC jack to the potentiometer (see connection sheme)  
![13](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/13.jpg)

14. do not forget to finish the connections with heatshrinks.  
![14](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/14.jpg)

15. now place the DC jack and potentiometer in the case, and solder the remaining wires according the connection scheme.  
![15](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/15.jpg)

16. Plug in a power supply to test the leds. **Pay attention: check if the puwersupply has a positive polarity (Tip/center is +, shell/outerbody is -). See indication below**

17. If everythin works, you can secure the wires with hot glue

18.Now place the mooon onto the stand and enjoy!!
