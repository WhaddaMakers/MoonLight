# Moon Lamp
![1](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/IMG_7904.jpg)


We're making a 3D printed moon lamp with a customised stand! Find out how we made it and how you can too!

## Project description

### What can this project do?
This project is a remake of the original moonlamp which you can find here:https://www.instructables.com/High-Detailed-Moon-Lamp/ .  
We've added Whadda's mascot Whaddy with Meshmixer (a 3D model program) so that it looks like a Whaddy shadow on the moon. We also made a sharp looking stand for it.
The Moonlamp can be powered with any decent power supply. In our case it was a 24VDC and a normal white 24V led strip.
The brightness is adjustable with a potentiometer, and we also built in a handy power jack.

## Material

![Ingredients](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/Ingredients.jpg)

### Ingredients:

* 1x 3D printed moon lamp
* 1x 3D printed LED holder
* 3x side plate
* 1x back plate
* 1x cross plate1
* 1x cross plate2
* 1x base plate
* 10cm of 24VDC LED strip (or any LED strip you prefer) 
* 24VDC power supply (make sure to use the rigt power according to your LED strip)
* 1x DC jack (optional)
* 1x potentiometer 1-10K (optional)
* soft electrical wires
* heat shrinks

### Tools:

* 3D printer
* soldering iron
* glue gun

## Prepping the build

### 3D printing the MOON and LED HOLDER
As mentioned before, all info on the original moonlamp can be found here https://www.instructables.com/High-Detailed-Moon-Lamp/ 

The STL files can be downloaded here:
- [Whaddy Moon Lamp.stl](https://vellemannv-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/nl_velleman_eu/EXgCJCqtD_RAr7959jyvImQBmb11U-QMWAOz8YXYz5xswQ?e=Y641Qv)
- [Led holder.stl](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/LEDholder.stl)


**When importiing the file in your slicer, move the moon about 8-10mm down. This way we will have a hole at the bottom for us to put the LEDs in...**

### Printing the template for the stand

We have made the pedestral out of PCB material on our PCB milling machine. But you can make it out of cardboard, 3D print it or make it with whatever you want :).
Below is the template that you can [download](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/Template.pdf) and print out to use it yourself!

![Template](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/Template.JPG)

### Prepping the connections

The connection sheme can be found below, we've added a potentiomer to adjust the brightness and build in a DC plug to power the moon lamp.
You can also connect your ledstip directly to a power supply, but in that case you can't adjust the brightnes and it's not very handy...

## Making the moon lamp

1. Take 'Cross plate 1' and 'Cross plate 2'.
  ![1](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/1.jpg)
1b. Then slide them together, as shown in the picture below
![1b](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/1b.jpg)

2. Take the 'base plate' and fix it to the cross that we just made. There are slots in the baseplate, align them with the protrusions of the cross plates anthe push them together  
![2](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/2.jpg)

3. Place a 'side plate' to the assembly. There is a slot in the side plate, push it on the protrusion of the 'cross plates'. Check the picture below. 
![3](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/3.jpg)

4. Now take another side plate, and first slide it onto the previous side plate.
![4](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/4.jpg)

5. Then push it in place...  
![5](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/5.jpg)

6. Repeat the last two steps for the next side plate.

7. The last side plate (or back plate) will be the hardest. You will have to wriggle it a bit to get it in place.

8. Now take the 3D printed LED strip holder and a piece of LED strip.   
![8](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/8.jpg) 
8b.Stick the Ledstrip onto the holder like in the picture below. Make sure the power wires are in the cut out of the holder!

9. Guide the wires trough the hole in the baseplate.  
![9](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/9.jpg)

10. If you are going to add a potentiometer, bend the pins in a 90Â° angle:  
![10](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/10.jpg)

11. Before we start soldering. Test fit the potentiometer and power jack, this way we know how long the cables need to be.
![11](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/11.jpg)

12. Start soldering wires to the DC jack (middle pin is +).
![12](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/12.jpg)

13. Solder the + wire from the DC jack to the potentiometer (see connection sheme). 
![13](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/13.jpg)

14. Do not forget to finish the connections with heatshrinks.  
![14](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/14.jpg)

15. Now place the DC jack and potentiometer in the case, and solder the remaining wires according the connection scheme.  
![15](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/15.jpg)

16. Plug in a power supply to test the leds. **Pay attention: check if the power supply has a positive polarity (Tip/center is +, shell/outerbody is -). Check the indication below**

17. If everything works, you can secure the wires with hot glue.

18.Now place the moon onto the stand and enjoy!!  ![18b](https://github.com/WhaddaMakers/MoonLight/blob/main/pictures/18b.jpg)
