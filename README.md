## Project description

### What can this project do?
This project is a remake of the original moonlamp made by ..... All info can be found in his very detailed tutorial here.
We've just added the Whaddy logo with Meshmixer (a 3D model program) so that it looks like Whaddy shadows on the moon. And made a sharp looking pedestal for it.
The Moonlamp can be powered with any decent (in our case) 24VDC power supply. It is lit up with a normal white 24V led strip, but you can choose any you prefer...
The brightness is adjustable with a potentiometer, and we've also built in handy power jack3
